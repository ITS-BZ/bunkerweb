The Whitelist plugin provides a comprehensive approach to explicitly allow access to your website based on various client attributes. This feature creates a security mechanism where visitors matching specific criteria are granted immediate access, while all others must pass regular security checks.

**How it works:**

1. You define criteria for visitors who should be "whitelisted" (*IP addresses, networks, rDNS, ASN, User-Agent, or URI patterns*).
2. When a visitor attempts to access your site, BunkerWeb checks if they match any of these whitelist criteria.
3. If a visitor matches any whitelist rule (and doesn't match any ignore rule), they are granted access to your site and **bypass all other security checks**.
4. If a visitor doesn't match any whitelist criteria, they proceed through all normal security checks as usual.
5. Whitelists can be automatically updated from external sources on a regular schedule.

### How to Use

Follow these steps to configure and use the Whitelist feature:

1. **Enable the feature:** The Whitelist feature is disabled by default. Set the `USE_WHITELIST` setting to `yes` to enable it.
2. **Configure allow rules:** Define which IPs, networks, rDNS patterns, ASNs, User-Agents, or URIs should be whitelisted.
3. **Set up ignore rules:** Specify any exceptions that should bypass the whitelist checks.
4. **Add external sources:** Configure URLs for automatically downloading and updating whitelist data.
5. **Monitor access:** Check the [web UI](web-ui.md) to see which visitors are being allowed or denied.

### Configuration Settings

**General**

| Setting         | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_WHITELIST` | `no`    | multisite | no       | **Enable Whitelist:** Set to `yes` to enable the whitelist feature. |

=== "IP Address"
    **What this does:** Whitelists visitors based on their IP address or network. These visitors will bypass all security checks.

    | Setting                    | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                |
    | -------------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `WHITELIST_IP`             |         | multisite | no       | **IP Whitelist:** List of IP addresses or networks (CIDR notation) to allow, separated by spaces.          |

=== "Reverse DNS"
    **What this does:** Whitelists visitors based on their domain name (in reverse). This is useful for allowing access to visitors from specific organizations or networks by their domain.

    | Setting                      | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                              |
    | ---------------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

=== "ASN"
    **What this does:** Whitelists visitors from specific network providers using Autonomous System Numbers. ASNs identify which provider or organization an IP belongs to.

    | Setting                     | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                             |

    | `WHITELIST_ASN_URLS`        |         | multisite | no       | **ASN Whitelist URLs:** List of URLs containing ASNs to whitelist, separated by spaces. |
    | `WHITELIST_IGNORE_ASN_URLS` |         | multisite | no       | **ASN Ignore List URLs:** List of URLs containing ASNs to ignore.                       |

=== "User Agent"
    **What this does:** Whitelists visitors based on what browser or tool they claim to be using. This is effective for allowing access to specific known tools or services.

    | Setting                            | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                             |

    | `WHITELIST_IGNORE_USER_AGENT_URLS` |         | multisite | no       | **User-Agent Ignore List URLs:** List of URLs containing User-Agent patterns to ignore.                 |

=== "URI"
    **What this does:** Whitelists requests to specific URLs on your site. This is helpful for allowing access to specific endpoints regardless of other factors.

    | Setting                     | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                     |

    | `WHITELIST_IGNORE_URI_URLS` |         | multisite | no       | **URI Ignore List URLs:** List of URLs containing URI patterns to ignore.                       |

!!! info "URL Format Support"
    All `*_URLS` settings support HTTP/HTTPS URLs as well as local file paths using the `file:///` prefix. Basic authentication is supported using the `http://user:pass@url` format.

!!! tip "Regular Updates"
    Whitelists from URLs are automatically downloaded and updated hourly to ensure your protection remains current with the latest trusted sources.

!!! warning "Security Bypass"
    Whitelisted visitors will completely **bypass all other security checks** in BunkerWeb, including WAF rules, rate limiting, bad bot detection, and any other security mechanisms. Only use the whitelist for trusted sources you're absolutely confident in.


### Example Configurations

=== "Basic Organization Access"

    A simple configuration that whitelists company office IPs:

    ```yaml
    USE_WHITELIST: "yes"
    WHITELIST_IP: "192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8 203.0.113.42"
    ```

=== "Advanced Configuration"

    A more comprehensive configuration with multiple whitelist criteria:

    ```yaml
    USE_WHITELIST: "yes"

    # Company and trusted partner assets
    WHITELIST_IP: "192.168.1.0/24 203.0.113.0/24"
    WHITELIST_RDNS: ".company.com .partner-company.org"
    WHITELIST_ASN: "12345 67890"  # Company and partner ASNs
    WHITELIST_USER_AGENT: "(?:\b)CompanyBot(?:\b) (?:\b)PartnerCrawler(?:\b)"

    # External trusted sources
    WHITELIST_IP_URLS: "https://example.com/trusted-networks.txt"
    WHITELIST_USER_AGENT_URLS: "https://example.com/trusted-crawlers.txt"
    ```

=== "Using Local Files"

    Configuration using local files for whitelists:

    ```yaml
    USE_WHITELIST: "yes"
    WHITELIST_IP_URLS: "file:///path/to/ip-whitelist.txt"
    WHITELIST_RDNS_URLS: "file:///path/to/rdns-whitelist.txt"
    WHITELIST_ASN_URLS: "file:///path/to/asn-whitelist.txt"
    WHITELIST_USER_AGENT_URLS: "file:///path/to/user-agent-whitelist.txt"
    WHITELIST_URI_URLS: "file:///path/to/uri-whitelist.txt"
    ```

=== "API Access Pattern"

    A configuration focused on allowing access to only specific API endpoints:

    ```yaml
    USE_WHITELIST: "yes"
    WHITELIST_URI: "^/api/v1/public/ ^/api/v1/status"
    WHITELIST_IP: "192.168.1.0/24"  # Internal network for all endpoints
    ```

=== "Well-Known Crawlers"

    A configuration that whitelists common search engine and social media crawlers:

    ```yaml
    USE_WHITELIST: "yes"

    # Verification with reverse DNS for added security
    WHITELIST_RDNS: ".googlebot.com .search.msn.com .crawl.yahoo.net .yandex.com .baidu.com .facebook.com"
    WHITELIST_RDNS_GLOBAL: "yes"  # Only check global IPs
    ```

    This configuration allows legitimate crawlers to index your site without being subject to rate limiting or other security measures that might block them. The rDNS checks help verify that crawlers are actually coming from their claimed companies.
