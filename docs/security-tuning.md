# Security tuning

BunkerWeb offers many security features that you can configure with [settings](settings.md). Even if the default values of settings ensure a minimal "security by default", we strongly recommend you tune them. By doing so you will be able to ensure the security level of your choice but also manage false positives.

!!! tip "Other settings"
    This section only focuses on security tuning, see the [settings section](settings.md) of the documentation for other settings.

## HTTP protocol

### Deny status code

STREAM support :warning:

The first thing to define is the kind of action to do when a client access is denied. You can control the action with the `DENY_HTTP_STATUS` setting which allows the following values :

- `403` : send a "classical" Forbidden HTTP status code (a web page or custom content will be displayed)
- `444` : close the connection (no web page or custom content will be displayed)

The default value is `403` and we suggest you set it to `444` only if you already fixed a lot of false positive, you are familiar with BunkerWeb and want a higher level of security.

When using stream mode, value is ignored and always set to `444` with effect of closing the connection.

### Default server

STREAM support :x:

In the HTTP protocol, the Host header is used to determine which server the client wants to send the request to. That header is facultative and may be missing from the request or can be set as an unknown value. This is a common case, a lot of bots are scanning the Internet and are trying to exploit services or simply doing some fingerprinting.

You can disable any request containing undefined or unknown Host value by setting `DISABLE_DEFAULT_SERVER` to `yes` (default : `no`). Please note that clients won't even receive a response, the TCP connection will be closed (using the special 444 status code of NGINX).

If you want to close SSL/TLS connection if [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) is undefined or unknown, you can set `DISABLE_DEFAULT_SERVER_STRICT_SNI` to `yes` (default : `no`). On the one hand, you can block attackers as soon as possible at SSL/TLS level but, in the other hand, you may have issues if your BunkerWeb instance is behind a reverse proxy configured to send HTTPS requests without SNI.

### Allowed methods

STREAM support :x:

You can control the allowed HTTP methods by listing them (separated with "|") in the `ALLOWED_METHODS` setting (default : `GET|POST|HEAD`). Clients sending a method which is not listed will get a "405 - Method Not Allowed".

!!! note Using POST

    If `POST` is required, then `OPTIONS` should also be specified to allow for the CORS pre-flight request.

### Max sizes

STREAM support :x:

You can control the maximum body size with the `MAX_CLIENT_SIZE` setting (default : `10m`). See [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/syntax.html) for accepted values. You can use the special value `0` to allow a body of infinite size (not recommended).

### Serve files

STREAM support :x:

To disable serving files from the www folder, you can set `SERVE_FILES` to `no` (default : `yes`). The value `no` is recommended if you use BunkerWeb as a reverse proxy.

### Headers

STREAM support :x:

Headers are very important when it comes to HTTP security. While some of them might be too verbose, others' verbosity will need to be increased, especially on the client-side.

#### Remove headers

STREAM support :x:

You can automatically remove verbose headers in the HTTP responses by using the `REMOVE_HEADERS` setting (default : `Server X-Powered-By X-AspNet-Version X-AspNetMvc-Version`).

#### Keep upstream headers

STREAM support :x:

You can automatically keep headers from upstream servers and prevent BunkerWeb from overriding them in the HTTP responses by using the `KEEP_UPSTREAM_HEADERS` setting (default : `Content-Security-Policy Permissions-Policy Feature-Policy X-Frame-Options`). A special value `*` is available to keep all headers. List of headers to keep must be separated with a space. Note that if the header is not present in the upstream response, it will be added by BunkerWeb.

#### Cookies

STREAM support :x:

When it comes to cookies security, we can use the following flags :

- HttpOnly : disable any access to the cookie from Javascript using document.cookie
- SameSite : policy when requests come from third-party websites
- Secure : only send cookies on HTTPS request

Cookie flags can be overridden with values of your choice by using the `COOKIE_FLAGS` setting (default : `* HttpOnly SameSite=Lax`). See [here](https://github.com/AirisX/nginx_cookie_flag_module) for accepted values.

The Secure flag can be automatically added if HTTPS is used by using the `COOKIE_AUTO_SECURE_FLAG` setting (default : `yes`). The value `no` is not recommended unless you know what you're doing.

#### Security headers

STREAM support :x:

Various security headers are available and most of them can be set using BunkerWeb settings. Here is the list of headers, the corresponding setting and default value :

|           Header            | Setting                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### CORS

STREAM support :x:

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) lets you manage how your service can be contacted from different origins. Please note that you will have to allow the `OPTIONS` HTTP method using the `ALLOWED_METHODS` if you want to enable it (more info [here](#allowed-methods)). Here is the list of settings related to CORS :

| Setting                  | Default                                                                              | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                         |

| `CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS`     | `DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range` | multisite | no       | Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header.                   |
| `CORS_DENY_REQUEST`      | `yes`                                                                                | multisite | no       | Deny request and don't send it to backend if Origin is not allowed. |

Here is some examples of possible values for `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` setting :

- `*` will allow all origin
- `^https://www\.example\.com$` will allow `https://www.example.com`
- `^https://.+\.example.com$` will allow any origins when domain ends with `.example.com`
- `^https://(www\.example1\.com|www\.example2\.com)$` will allow both `https://www.example1.com` and `https://www.example2.com`
- `^https?://www\.example\.com$` will allow both `https://www.example.com` and `http://www.example.com`

## HTTPS / SSL/TLS

Besides the HTTPS / SSL/TLS configuration, the following settings related to HTTPS / SSL/TLS can be set :

|            Setting            |      Default      | Description                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS`    |       `no`        | When set to `yes`, will redirect every HTTP request to HTTPS even if BunkerWeb is not configured with HTTPS. |
| `AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS` |       `yes`       | When set to `yes`, will redirect every HTTP request to HTTPS only if BunkerWeb is configured with HTTPS.     |
|        `SSL_PROTOCOLS`        | `TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3` | List of supported SSL/TLS protocols when SSL is enabled.                                                     |
|            `HTTP2`            |       `yes`       | When set to `yes`, will enable HTTP2 protocol support when using HTTPS.                                      |
|            `HTTP3`            |       `no`        | When set to `yes`, will enable HTTP3 protocol support when using HTTPS.                                      |
|     `HTTP3_ALT_SVC_PORT`      |       `443`       | HTTP3 alternate service port. This value will be used as part of the Alt-Svc header.                         |
|         `LISTEN_HTTP`         |       `yes`       | When set to `no`, BunkerWeb will not listen for HTTP requests. Useful if you want HTTPS only for example.    |

!!! example "About HTTP3"
    HTTP/3 is the next version of the HTTP protocol. It is based on Google's QUIC protocol which is a transport layer protocol that provides security and reliability features. HTTP/3 is designed to improve the performance of websites and web applications.

    **Remember that NGINX's support for HTTP/3 is still experimental and may not be suitable for all use cases.**

### Let's Encrypt

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

BunkerWeb comes with automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation and renewal. This is the easiest way of getting HTTPS / SSL/TLS working out of the box for public-facing web applications. Please note that you will need to set up proper DNS A record(s) for each of your domains pointing to your public IP(s) where BunkerWeb is accessible.

Here is the list of related settings :

|              Setting               |         Default          | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

|   `LETS_ENCRYPT_CLEAR_OLD_CERTS`   |           `no`           | Clear old certificates when renewing.                                                                                                                                         |

!!! info "Information and behavior"
    - The `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_CREDENTIAL_ITEM` setting is a multiple setting and can be used to set multiple items for the DNS provider. The items will be saved as a cache file and Certbot will read the credentials from it.

    - If no `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_PROPAGATION` setting is set, the provider's default propagation time will be used.

!!! warning "Wildcard certificates"
    Wildcard certificates are only available with DNS challenges. If you want to use them, you will need to set the `USE_LETS_ENCRYPT_WILDCARD` setting to `yes`.

**Available DNS Providers**

Full Let's Encrypt automation is fully working with stream mode as long as you open the `80/tcp` port from the outside. Please note that you will need to use the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting in order to choose your listening SSL/TLS port.

### Custom certificate

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

If you want to use your own certificates, here is the list of related settings :

| Setting           | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_CUSTOM_SSL`  | `no`    | multisite | no       | Use custom HTTPS / SSL/TLS certificate.                                          |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_CERT` |         | multisite | no       | Full path of the certificate or bundle file (must be readable by the scheduler). |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_KEY`  |         | multisite | no       | Full path of the key file (must be readable by the scheduler).                   |

When `USE_CUSTOM_SSL` is set to `yes`, BunkerWeb will check every day if the custom certificate specified in `CUSTOM_SSL_CERT` is modified and will reload NGINX if that's the case.

When using stream mode, you will need to use the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting in order to choose your listening SSL/TLS port.

### Self-signed

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

If you want to quickly test HTTPS / SSL/TLS for staging/dev environment you can configure BunkerWeb to generate self-signed certificates, here is the list of related settings :

|          Setting           |        Default         | Description                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GENERATE_SELF_SIGNED_SSL` |          `no`          | When set to `yes`, HTTPS / SSL/TLS will be enabled with automatic self-signed certificate generation and renewal from Let's Encrypt. |
|  `SELF_SIGNED_SSL_EXPIRY`  |         `365`          | Number of days for the certificate expiration (**-days** value used with **openssl**).                                               |
|   `SELF_SIGNED_SSL_SUBJ`   | `/CN=www.example.com/` | Certificate subject to use (**-subj** value used with **openssl**).                                                                  |

When using stream mode, you will need to use the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting in order to choose your listening SSL/TLS port.

## ModSecurity

STREAM support :x:

ModSecurity is integrated and enabled by default alongside the OWASP Core Rule Set within BunkerWeb. Here is the list of related settings :

| `MODSECURITY_SEC_AUDIT_LOG_PARTS` | `ABCFHZ`       | SecAuditLogParts directive of ModSecurity.                                                                                                                         |

!!! warning "ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set"
    **We strongly recommend keeping both ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set enabled**. The only downsides are the false positives that may occur. But they can be fixed with some efforts and the CRS team maintains a list of exclusions for common applications (e.g., WordPress, Nextcloud, Drupal, Cpanel, ...).

You can choose between the following versions of the OWASP Core Rule Set :

- **3** : The version [v3.3.7](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.3.7) of the OWASP Core Rule Set
- **4** : The version [v4.10.0](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v4.10.0) of the OWASP Core Rule Set (***default***)
- **nightly** : The latest [nightly](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/nightly) build of the OWASP Core Rule Set which is updated every day

!!! example "OWASP Core Rule Set's nightly build"
    The nightly build of the OWASP Core Rule Set is updated every day and contains the latest rules. It is recommended to use it in a staging environment before using it in production.

Tuning ModSecurity and the CRS can be done using [custom configurations](quickstart-guide.md#custom-configurations) :

- modsec-crs : before the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded
- modsec : after the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded (also used if CRS is not loaded)
- crs-plugins-before : before the CRS plugins are loaded
- crs-plugins-after : after the CRS plugins are loaded

For example, you can add a custom configuration with type `modsec-crs` to add CRS exclusions :

```conf
SecAction \
 "id:900130,\
  phase:1,\
  nolog,\
  pass,\
  t:none,\
  setvar:tx.crs_exclusions_wordpress=1"
```

You can also add a custom configuration with type `modsec` to update loaded CRS rules :

```conf
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" "id:1,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-xss,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-rce"
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "/wp-admin/options.php" "id:2,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-xss"
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "^/wp-json/yoast" "id:3,ctl:ruleRemoveById=930120"
```

!!! info "Order of execution"
    ModSecurity order of execution is as follows :

    1. *OWASP* CRS configuration
    2. Custom plugins configuration (`crs-plugins-before`)
    3. Custom plugins rules **before CRS rules** (`crs-plugins-before`)
    4. Downloaded plugins configuration
    5. Downloaded plugins rules **before CRS rules**
    6. Custom CRS rules (`modsec-crs`)
    6. *OWASP* CRS rules
    7. Custom plugins rules **after CRS rules** (`crs-plugins-after`)
    8. Downloaded plugins rules **after CRS rules**
    9. Custom rules (`modsec`)

## CrowdSec

STREAM support :x:

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdsec.svg){ align=center, width="600" }
</figure>

This BunkerWeb plugin acts as a [CrowdSec](https://crowdsec.net/) bouncer. It will deny requests based on the decision of your CrowdSec API. Not only you will benefinit from the crowdsourced blacklist, you can also configure [scenarios](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/concepts#scenarios) to automatically ban IPs based on suspicious behaviors.

### Setup

=== "Docker"
    **Acquisition file**

    You will need to run CrowdSec instance and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. Because BunkerWeb is based on NGINX, you can use the `nginx` value for the `type` parameter in your acquisition file (assuming that BunkerWeb logs are stored "as is" without additional data) :

    ```yaml
    filenames:
       - /var/log/bunkerweb.log
    labels:
        type: nginx
    ```

    **Syslog**

    For container-based integrations, we recommend you to redirect the logs of the BunkerWeb container to a syslog service that will store the logs so CrowdSec can access it easily. Here is an example configuration for syslog-ng that will store raw logs coming from BunkerWeb to a local `/var/log/bunkerweb.log` file :

    ```syslog
    @version: 4.7

    source s_net {
        udp(
            ip("0.0.0.0")
        );
    };

    template t_imp {
        template("$MSG\n");
        template_escape(no);
    };

    destination d_file {
        file("/var/log/bunkerweb.log" template(t_imp));
    };

    log {
        source(s_net);
        destination(d_file);
    };
    ```

    **Optional : Application Security Component**

    CrowdSec also provides an [Application Security Component](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/appsec/intro) that can be used to protect your application from attacks. You can configure the plugin to send requests to the AppSec Component for further analysis. If you want to use it, you will need to create another acquisition file for the AppSec Component :

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
        type: appsec
    listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    **Docker Compose**

    Here is the docker-compose boilerplate that you can use (**don't forget to edit the bouncer key**) :

    ```yaml
    services:
        bunkerweb:
            image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:1.6.0-rc4

=== "Linux"

    You'll need to install CrowdSec and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. To do so, you can follow the [official documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec).

    For CrowdSec to parse BunkerWeb logs, you have to add the following lines to your acquisition file located in `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml` :

    ```yaml
    filenames:
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/access.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/error.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/modsec_audit.log
    labels:
        type: nginx
    ```

    Now we have to add our custom bouncer to the CrowdSec API. To do so, you can use the `cscli` tool :

    ```shell
    sudo cscli bouncers add crowdsec-bunkerweb-bouncer/v1.6
    ```

    !!! warning "API key"
        Keep the key generated by the `cscli` command, you will need it later.

    Now restart the CrowdSec service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    **Optional : Application Security Component with Linux**

    If you want to use the AppSec Component, you will need to create another acquisition file for it located in `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml` :

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
        type: appsec
    listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    And you will need to install the AppSec Component's collections :

    ```shell
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules
    ```

    Now you just have to restart the CrowdSec service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    If you need more information about the AppSec Component, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/appsec/intro).

    **Settings**

    Now you can configure the plugin by adding the following settings to your BunkerWeb configuration file :

    ```env
    USE_CROWDSEC=yes
    CROWDSEC_API=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    CROWDSEC_API_KEY=<The key provided by cscli>
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422 # Comment if you don't want to use the AppSec Component
    ```

    And finally reload the BunkerWeb service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl reload bunkerweb
    ```

## Bad behavior

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

When attackers search for and/or exploit vulnerabilities they might generate some "suspicious" HTTP status codes that a "regular" user won’t generate within a period of time. If we detect that kind of behavior we can ban the offending IP address and force the attacker to come up with a new one.

That kind of security measure is implemented and enabled by default in BunkerWeb and is called "Bad behavior". Here is the list of the related settings :

|           Setting           |            Default            | Description                                                                  |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR`      |             `yes`             | When set to `yes`, the Bad behavior feature will be enabled.                 |
| `BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES` | `400 401 403 404 405 429 444` | List of HTTP status codes considered as "suspicious".                        |
|   `BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME`   |            `86400`            | The duration time (in seconds) of a ban when a client reached the threshold. |
|  `BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD`   |             `10`              | Maximum number of "suspicious" HTTP status codes within the time period.     |
|  `BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME`  |             `60`              | Period of time during which we count "suspicious" HTTP status codes.         |

In other words, with the default values, if a client generates more than `10` status codes from the list `400 401 403 404 405 429 444` within `60` seconds their IP address will be banned for `86400` seconds.

When using stream mode, only the `444` status code will count as "bad".

## Antibot

STREAM support :x:

Attackers will certainly use automated tools to exploit/find some vulnerabilities in your web applications. One countermeasure is to challenge the users to detect if they look like a bot. If the challenge is solved, we consider the client as "legitimate" and they can access the web application.

That kind of security is implemented but not enabled by default in BunkerWeb and is called "Antibot". Here is the list of supported challenges :

- **Cookie** : send a cookie to the client, we expect to get the cookie back on other requests
- **Javascript** : force a client to solve a computation challenge using Javascript
- **Captcha** : force the client to solve a classical captcha (no external dependencies)
- **hCaptcha** : force the client to solve a captcha from hCaptcha
- **reCAPTCHA** : force the client to get a minimum score with Google reCAPTCHA
- **Turnstile** : enforce rate limiting and access control for APIs and web applications using various mechanisms with Coudflare Turnstile

Here is the list of related settings :

| Setting                     | Default      | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                                    |

| `ANTIBOT_HCAPTCHA_SECRET`   |              | multisite | no       | Secret for hCaptcha challenge.                                                                                                 |
| `ANTIBOT_TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` |              | multisite | no       | Sitekey for Turnstile challenge.                                                                                               |
| `ANTIBOT_TURNSTILE_SECRET`  |              | multisite | no       | Secret for Turnstile challenge.                                                                                                |
| `ANTIBOT_TIME_RESOLVE`      | `60`         | multisite | no       | Maximum time (in seconds) clients have to resolve the challenge. Once this time has passed, a new challenge will be generated. |
| `ANTIBOT_TIME_VALID`        | `86400`      | multisite | no       | Maximum validity time of solved challenges. Once this time has passed, clients will need to resolve a new one.                 |

Please note that antibot feature is using a cookie to maintain a session with clients. If you are using BunkerWeb in a clustered environment, you will need to set the `SESSIONS_SECRET` and `SESSIONS_NAME` settings to another value than the default one (which is `random`). You will find more info about sessions [here](settings.md#sessions).

## Blacklisting, whitelisting and greylisting

The blacklisting security feature is very easy to understand : if a specific criteria is met, the client will be banned. As for the whitelisting, it's the exact opposite : if a specific criteria is met, the client will be allowed and no additional security check will be done. Whereas for the greylisting :  if a specific criteria is met, the client will be allowed but additional security checks will be done.

You can configure blacklisting, whitelisting and greylisting at the same time. If that's the case, note that whitelisting is executed before blacklisting and greylisting : even if a criteria is true for all of them, the client will be whitelisted.

### Blacklisting

STREAM support :warning:

You can use the following settings to set up blacklisting :

| Setting                            | Default                                                                                                                        | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

When using stream mode, only IP, RDNS and ASN checks will be done.

## Reverse scan

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

Reverse scan is a feature designed to detect open ports by establishing TCP connections with clients' IP addresses.
Consider adding this feature if you want to detect possible open proxies or connections from servers.

We provide a list of suspicious ports by default but it can be modified to fit your needs. Be mindful, adding too many ports to the list can significantly slow down clients' connections due to the network checks. If a listed port is open, the client's access will be denied.

Please be aware, this feature is new and further improvements will be added soon.

Here is the list of settings related to reverse scan :

|        Setting         |          Default           | Description                                               |
| :--------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `USE_REVERSE_SCAN`   |            `no`            | When set to `yes`, will enable ReverseScan.               |
|  `REVERSE_SCAN_PORTS`  | `22 80 443 3128 8000 8080` | List of suspicious ports to scan.                         |
| `REVERSE_SCAN_TIMEOUT` |           `500`            | Specify the maximum timeout (in ms) when scanning a port. |

## BunkerNet

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

BunkerNet is a crowdsourced database of malicious requests shared between all BunkerWeb instances over the world.

If you enable BunkerNet, malicious requests will be sent to a remote server and will be analyzed by our systems. By doing so, we can extract malicious data from everyone's reports and give back the results to each BunkerWeb instances participating into BunkerNet.

Besides the enhanced security, enabling BunkerNet will let you benefit from extra features such as the integration with CrowdSec Console.

The setting used to enable or disable BunkerNet is `USE_BUNKERNET` (default : `yes`).

### CrowdSec Console integration

If you don't already know about it, [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/?utm_campaign=bunkerweb&utm_source=doc) is an open-source cybersecurity solution leveraging crowdsourced intelligence to mitigate cyber threats. Think of it like Waze but applied to cybersecurity : when a specific server is attacked, other systems around the globe will be informed and protected from the same attackers. You will find more information on their website [here](https://www.crowdsec.net/about?utm_campaign=bunkerweb&utm_source=blog).

Thanks to a partnership with CrowdSec, you can enroll your BunkerWeb instances to your [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup?utm_source=external-blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-integration). In other words, the attacks blocked by BunkerWeb will be visible the same way it does for attacks blocked by CrowdSec Security Engines.

Please note that CrowdSec doesn't need to be installed at all (even if we recommend you to try it with the [CrowdSec plugin for BunkerWeb](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb-plugins/tree/main/crowdsec) to enhance the security of your web services) and you can still enroll your Security Engines into the same Console account.

**Step #1 : create your CrowdSec Console account**

Go to the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup?utm_source=external-blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-integration) and register your account if you don't already have one. Once it's done, write down your enroll key by going to "Security Engines", then "Engines" and click on "Add Security Engine" :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity1.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Get your Crowdsec Console enroll key</figcaption>
</figure>

**Step #2 : get your BunkerNet ID**

Activating the BunkerNet feature (which is the case by default) is mandatory if you want to enroll your BunkerWeb instance(s) into your CrowdSec console. You can do it by setting `USE_BUNKERNET` to `yes`.

Get your BunkerNet ID on Docker :

```shell
docker exec my-bw-scheduler cat /var/cache/bunkerweb/bunkernet/instance.id
```

Get your BunkerNet ID on Linux :

```shell
cat /var/cache/bunkerweb/bunkernet/instance.id
```

**Step #3 : enroll your instance using the Panel**

Once you have noted your BunkerNet ID and CrowdSec Console enroll key, you can [order the free product "BunkerNet / CrowdSec" on the Panel](https://panel.bunkerweb.io/order/bunkernet/11?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=doc). Please note that you will need to create an account if you don't already have one.

You can now select the "BunkerNet / CrowdSec" service and fill out the form by pasting your BunkerNet ID and CrowdSec Console enroll key :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity2.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Enroll your BunkerWeb instance into the CrowdSec Console</figcaption>
</figure>

**Step #4 : accept new security engine on the Console**

Last but not least, you need to go back to your CrowdSec Console and accept the new Security Engine :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity3.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Accept enroll into the CrowdSec Console</figcaption>
</figure>

**Congratulations, your BunkerWeb instance is now enrolled into your CrowdSec Console !**

Pro tip : when viewing your alerts, click on "columns" and tick the "context" checkbox to get access to BunkerWeb specific data.

## DNSBL

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

DNSBL or "DNS BlackList" is an external list of malicious IPs that you query using the DNS protocol. Automatic querying of that kind of blacklist is supported by BunkerWeb. If a remote DNSBL server of your choice says that the IP address of the client is in the blacklist, it will be banned.

Here is the list of settings related to DNSBL :

|   Setting    |                       Default                       | Description                                    |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_DNSBL`  |                        `yes`                        | When set to `yes`, will enable DNSBL checking. |
| `DNSBL_LIST` | `bl.blocklist.de sbl.spamhaus.org xbl.spamhaus.org` | List of DNSBL servers to ask.                  |

## Limiting

BunkerWeb supports applying a limit policy to :

- Number of connections per IP
- Number of requests per IP and URL within a time period

Please note that it should not be considered as an effective solution against DoS or DDoS but rather as an anti-bruteforce measure or rate limit policy for API.

In both cases (connections or requests) if the limit is reached, the client will receive the HTTP status "429 - Too Many Requests".

### Connections

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The following settings are related to the Limiting connections feature :

|         Setting         | Default | Description                                                                                |
| :---------------------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `USE_LIMIT_CONN`     |  `yes`  | When set to `yes`, will limit the maximum number of concurrent connections for a given IP. |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_HTTP1`  |  `10`   | Maximum number of concurrent connections when using HTTP1 protocol.                        |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_HTTP2`  |  `100`  | Maximum number of concurrent streams when using HTTP2 protocol.                            |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_STREAM` |  `10`   | Maximum number of connections per IP when using stream.                                    |

### Requests

STREAM support :x:

The following settings are related to the Limiting requests feature :

| Setting          | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_LIMIT_REQ`  | `yes`   | multisite | no       | Activate limit requests feature.                                                              |
| `LIMIT_REQ_URL`  | `/`     | multisite | yes      | URL (PCRE regex) where the limit request will be applied or special value / for all requests. |
| `LIMIT_REQ_RATE` | `2r/s`  | multisite | yes      | Rate to apply to the URL (s for second, m for minute, h for hour and d for day).              |

Please note that you can add different rates for different URLs by adding a number as a suffix to the settings for example : `LIMIT_REQ_URL_1=^/url1$`, `LIMIT_REQ_RATE_1=5r/d`, `LIMIT_REQ_URL_2=^/url2/subdir/.*$`, `LIMIT_REQ_RATE_2=1r/m`, ...

Another important thing to note is that `LIMIT_REQ_URL` values are PCRE regex.

## Country

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The country security feature allows you to apply policy based on the country of the IP address of clients :

- Deny any access if the country is in a blacklist
- Only allow access if the country is in a whitelist (other security checks will still be executed)

Here is the list of related settings :

| Setting             | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BLACKLIST_COUNTRY` |         | multisite | no       | Deny access if the country of the client is in the list (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format separated with spaces).     |
| `WHITELIST_COUNTRY` |         | multisite | no       | Deny access if the country of the client is not in the list (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format separated with spaces). |

Using both country blacklist and whitelist at the same time makes no sense. If you do, please note that only the whitelist will be executed.

## Authentication

### Auth basic

STREAM support :x:

You can quickly protect sensitive resources like the admin area for example, by requiring HTTP basic authentication. Here is the list of related settings :

|        Setting        |      Default      | Description                                                                                  |
| :-------------------: | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `USE_AUTH_BASIC`    |       `no`        | When set to `yes` HTTP auth basic will be enabled.                                           |
| `AUTH_BASIC_LOCATION` |    `sitewide`     | Location (URL) of the sensitive resource. Use special value `sitewide` to enable everywhere. |
|   `AUTH_BASIC_USER`   |    `changeme`     | The username required.                                                                       |
| `AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD` |    `changeme`     | The password required.                                                                       |
|   `AUTH_BASIC_TEXT`   | `Restricted area` | Text to display in the auth prompt.                                                          |

### Auth request

You can deploy complex authentication (e.g. SSO), by using the auth request settings (see [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/) for more information on the feature). Please note that you will find [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) and [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) examples in the [repository](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/tree/v1.6.0-rc4/examples).

**Auth request settings are related to reverse proxy rules.**

| Setting                                 | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                          |

| `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST_SIGNIN_URL` |         | multisite | yes      | Redirect clients to sign-in URL when using REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST (used when auth_request call returned 401).    |
| `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST_SET`        |         | multisite | yes      | List of variables to set from the authentication provider, separated with ; (values of auth_request_set directives). |

## Monitoring and reporting

### Monitoring <img src='../assets/img/pro-icon.svg' alt='crow pro icon' height='24px' width='24px' style="transform : translateY(3px);"> (PRO)

STREAM support :x:

The monitoring plugin lets you collect and retrieve metrics about BunkerWeb. By enabling it, your instance(s) will start collecting various data related to attacks, requests and performance. You can then retrieve them by calling the `/monitoring` API endpoint on regular basis or by using other plugins like the Prometheus exporter one.

**List of features**

- Enable collection of various BunkerWeb metrics
- Retrieve metrics from the API
- Use in combination with other plugins (e.g. Prometheus exporter)
- Dedicate UI page to monitor your instance(s)

**List of settings**

| Setting                        | Default | Context | Multiple | Description                                   |

### Prometheus exporter <img src='../assets/img/pro-icon.svg' alt='crow pro icon' height='24px' width='24px' style="transform : translateY(3px);"> (PRO)

STREAM support :x:

The Prometheus exporter plugin adds a [Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) on your BunkerWeb instance(s). When enabled, you can configure your Prometheus instance(s) to scrape a specific endpoint on Bunkerweb and gather internal metrics.

We also provide a [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20755-bunkerweb/) that you can import into your own instance and connect to your own Prometheus datasource.

**Please note that the use of Prometheus exporter plugin requires to enable the Monitoring plugin (`USE_MONITORING=yes`)**

**List of features**

- Prometheus exporter providing internal BunkerWeb metrics
- Dedicated and configurable port, listen IP and URL
- Whitelist IP/network for maximum security

**List of settings**

Data is invaluable, especially in digital environments where it's susceptible to loss due to various factors such as hardware failures, software errors, or human mistakes. To mitigate such risks and ensure the safety and availability of your important files, it's crucial to establish a robust backup system. This section outlines the backup functionality provided by BunkerWeb, allowing you to securely store your data in a custom location through regular backups.

!!! info "Information and behavior"

    The importance of backups cannot be overstated. They serve as a safety net against data loss scenarios, providing a means to restore your system to a previous state in case of unexpected events. Regular backups not only safeguard your data but also offer peace of mind, knowing that you have a reliable mechanism in place to recover from any mishaps.

#### Manual backup

To manually initiate a backup, execute the following command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

This command will create a backup of your database and store it in the backup directory specified in the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting.

You can also specify a custom directory for the backup by providing the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` environment variable when executing the command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/path/to/backup/directory bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it -e BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/path/to/backup/directory <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

    ```bash
    docker cp <scheduler_container>:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/backup/directory
    ```

!!! note "Specifications for MariaDB/MySQL"

    In case you are using MariaDB/MySQL, you may encounter the following error when trying to backup your database:

    ```bash
    caching_sha2_password could not be loaded: Error loading shared library /usr/lib/mariadb/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so
    ```

    To resolve this issue, you can execute the following command to change the authentication plugin to `mysql_native_password`:

    ```sql
    ALTER USER 'yourusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'youpassword';
    ```

    If you're using the Docker integration, you can add the following command to the `docker-compose.yml` file to automatically change the authentication plugin:

    === "MariaDB"

        ```yaml
        bw-db:
            image: mariadb:<version>
            command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
            ...
        ```

    === "MySQL"

        ```yaml
        bw-db:
            image: mysql:<version>
            command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
            ...
        ```

#### Manual restore

To manually initiate a restore, execute the following command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup restore
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup restore
    ```

This command will create a temporary backup of your database in `/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups` and restore your database to the latest backup available in the backup directory specified in the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting.

You can also specify a custom backup file for the restore by providing the path to it as an argument when executing the command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup restore /path/to/backup/file
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker cp /path/to/backup/file <scheduler_container>:/path/to/backup/file
    ```

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup restore /path/to/backup/file
    ```

!!! example "In case of failure"

    Don't worry if the restore fails, you can always restore your database to the previous state by executing the command again but with the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting set to `/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups`:

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups bwcli plugin backup restore
        ```

    === "Docker"

        ```bash
        docker cp <scheduler_container>:/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups /var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups

### Initialize a migration

To manually initialize a migration, execute the following command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin migration migrate /path/to/migration/file
    ```

=== "Docker"

    1. Copy the migration file to the container:

        ```bash
        docker cp /path/to/migration/file <scheduler_container>:/path/to/migration/file
        ```

    2. Initialize the migration:

        ```bash
        docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin migration migrate /path/to/migration/file
        ```

This command seamlessly migrates your BunkerWeb data to precisely match the configuration outlined in the migration file.

## Security.txt

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The Security.txt plugin allows you to easily create a `security.txt` file for your website, providing a standardized method for security researchers and others to report security vulnerabilities. By enabling this feature, you can enhance your site's security posture and streamline the reporting process for potential security issues.

**List of features**

- **Streamlined and Standardized Reporting:** Implement a standardized and user-friendly method for security researchers to report vulnerabilities, ensuring clear communication and timely responses.
- **Enhanced Security Posture and Transparency:** Strengthen your site's security by providing clear guidelines for reporting security issues, fostering transparency and trust within the security community.
- **Customizable and User-Friendly Configuration:** Customize the `security.txt` file to include specific contact information and security policies, and manage it easily through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Compliance with Best Practices:** Align with industry best practices by implementing a `security.txt` file, demonstrating your commitment to security and fostering a collaborative security culture.

!!! warning "Settings required"
    To enable the Security.txt plugin, you need to at least set the `SECURITYTXT_CONTACT` setting to a valid value to specify the contact information for reporting security vulnerabilities. If this setting is not configured, the `security.txt` file won't be served.
